Stept 1 Update Your Pi and Install The CircuitPython Library
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get full-upgrade
sudo reboot
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install --upgrade setuptools

Step 2 Install The CircuitPython Library:
cd ~
sudo pip3 install --upgrade adafruit-python-shell
wget hhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Scripts/master/raspi-blinka.py

sudo python3 raspi-blinka.py

Step 3 Check That Your Display Can Be Seen:
sudo i2cdetect -y 1

If the table isn't showing correctly at this point then maybe your I2C communication isn’t turned on. You can do this through the configuration utility. You can enter the utility by using the following command:
sudo raspi-config

It is also possible that your wiring is not correct. If you get a table full of characters (all addresses shown) then you’ve probably made a wiring mistake as this happens if SDA is shorted to ground. Go back and re-check your connections to your Pi and display and re-check that you’ve got I2C communication enabled after a reboot.

Step 4 Install The OLED Stats Display Script
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306
sudo apt-get install python3-pil
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/mklements/OLED_Sta...

cd OLED_Stats
python3 stats.py

Step 5 Automating The Script To Run On Start-up
crontab –e

Add the following line to the end of the file to run the script:
@reboot cd /home/pi/OLED_Stats && python3 stats.py &
